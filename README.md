# Donny Nary's Webpage

this is a page where I'll share some information about myself and the work I am doing in BioStatistics/BioInformatics. So far, I've done some work to analyze data on penguins and other topics and themes

## Work with Penguins

I started learning how to use R by working with the Palmer penguins data set. We ran an analysis using a small subset of 44 penguins. If you are interested, you cansee my analysis [here](DonnyNary.github.io/BiostatisticsAnalysis/PenguinsAnalysis.html)
